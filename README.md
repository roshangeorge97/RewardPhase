> our aim

*this project aims to help teens and mobile-gamers who cannot afford in-game purchases.*

>how this platform basically works

*the basic concept is to distribute the ad-revenue recieved from the games which we recommended our users to play. Users can
withdraw thier rewards in form of google play promo-codes, or thier favourite in-game purchase. It was noted that many
teens dont have bank account of thier own, so in this case we come into playing buying them thier favourite in-game purchase.*

> what the site offers?

*users can use this platform to track the progress of thier reward, like how much more time they need to spend playing the game?,
any bonus tasks available in between, to reduce thier time waiting for rewards, daily gifts ect.*

>how do we payout?

*for paying out we will use whatsapp, as whatsapp recently got a UPI payment feature too, it made our work much easier.*

>how do we verify if a user finishes a task?

*after completing each tasks, users will be asked to send a screenshot of thier progress for that day through whatsapp,
where we appoint few members from our commmunity to check if the screenshots are realtime, and not old.*

>legal notice?

*before we recommmend any tasks and games to our users, we have to make a deal and connect with the community members of that
games/tasks hosting companies.*
